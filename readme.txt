So the original config *configuration-office* has project and visio removed. If you want those features, use the name from the configuration-office file and overwrite the file.
Assuming you have the files in your desktop, you can run the bat file. If you dont, you can modify it to the directory your using.
I recommend having it on your desktop and named "office" so you do not have to run the bat file.

Run the bat when you are ready.
